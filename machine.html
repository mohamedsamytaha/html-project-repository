 mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?" </b></p>

<p><b>Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI: </b></p>

<ol>
  <li>Thinking humanly</li>
  <li>Thinking rationally</li>
  <li>Acting humanly </li>
  <li>Acting humanly </li> >
</ol>
<p><b>The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell focus particularly on rational agents that
 act to achieve the best outcome, noting "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel and Norvig 4).</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines AI as  "algorithms enabled by constraints, 
exposed by representations that support models 
targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together."</b></p>
