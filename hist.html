 <b>Artificial ntelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity. Aristotle's
 development of the syllogism and it's use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankind's quest to understand its 
 own intelligence. While the roots are long and deep, the history of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans 
 less than a century. The following is a quick look at some of the most important events in AI
