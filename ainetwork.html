Artificial neural networks are built like the human brain, with neuron nodes interconnected like a web. The human brain has hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.
 Each neuron is made up of a cell body that is responsible for processing information by carrying information towards (inputs) and away (outputs) from the brain.

An ANN has hundreds or thousands of artificial neurons called processing units, which are interconnected by nodes. These processing units are made up of input and output units.
 The input units receive various forms and structures of information based on an internal weighting system, and the neural network attempts to learn about the information presented 
 to produce one output report. Just like humans need rules and guidelines to come up with a result or output, ANNs also use a set of learning rules called backpropagation,
 an abbreviation for backward propagation of error, to perfect their output results.
